<h1>Multi-Platform Video Performance Aggregation</h1>



<h2>🧠 Project Overview</h2>
This project aggregates monthly video performance metrics across multiple digital platforms. It uses SQLX (Dataform syntax) to build an incremental BigQuery model that combines key data points such as impressions, revenue, views, and engagement across platforms like Platform1 and Platform2.
<br />

<h2>🎯 Features</h2>
- Incremental loading with monthly partitioning<br />
- Revenue and impression aggregation<br />
- Cross-platform performance merging<br />
- Currency conversion (USD to GBP)<br />
- Keyed by unique combination of brand, project, and month<br />

<h2>🔧Technologies Used</h2>
- Dataform SQLX<br />
- Google BigQuery<br />
- SQL<br />
- Incremental ELT logic<br />

<h2>📈 Business Impact</h2>

✅ Consolidates video performance data from multiple platforms into a single, trusted dataset

✅ Enables cross-platform comparison of key KPIs (views, impressions, revenue, watch time)

✅ Saves time by automating monthly data aggregation and transformation

✅ Improves decision-making for marketing and media teams through unified insights

✅ Supports financial planning with standardized revenue figures (USD to GBP)

✅ Reduces manual errors and reporting delays through automated incremental loads

✅ Lays the foundation for dashboards, trend analysis, and ROI reporting
